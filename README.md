FAQ
-----------
Q: My mouse cursor is stuck, what to do? \
A: This is a bug in Unity Mod Manager. I have that in other games, too. Unfortunately I don't know how to fix it. Sometimes it gets unstuck, when using ALT+TAB. If you have a controller you can use that instead of a mouse.

Q: Now my controller can't go right either? \
A: That's on Massive Monsters. If you press F10 it opens a report box. This prevents right movement for some reason. Press F10 again to fix it. If you need to mod's menu a lot, I recommend setting a different hotkey (like F11).
